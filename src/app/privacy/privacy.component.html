                    <h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>

                    <p>We may collect two types of data and information from our Users. The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to you, which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Services (“<span class="text-bold">Non-personal Information</span>“.We are not aware of the identity from which the Non-personal Information is collected. Non-personal Information which is collected may include your aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information about your device (e.g., the device you use, the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the website’s domain name from which you linked to the Services, etc.), in order to enhance the functionality of the Services. We may also collect information about your activity on the Services (e.g., pages viewed, online browsing, clicks, actions, timestamps, etc.). The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“<span class="text-bold">Personal Information</span>“. Such information may include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>

                                    When you register to the Services through the Application or our website, we may collect from you the following information: full name, email address, home address, hometown, nationality, birthdate, phone number, as well as information required for our compliance with regulatory Know Your Customer requirements, such as passport or other identification number, and any other information you agreed to share with us.

                            </ul>

                    <h4>COOKIES AND GOOGLE ANALYTICS</h4>

                    <p>We may use cookies and other technologies or methods of web and mobile analysis (e.g., pixels, Mixpanel, Google Analytics, etc.) to gather, store, and track certain information related with your access to and activity through the Services, including when you visit our website.

These purposes include, among other things, allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, enabling automatic activation of certain features, remembering your preferences and making the interaction between you and the Services quicker, easier and smoother. Our website may use the following types of cookies:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="text-bold">Session Cookies</span>

                            <span class="text-bold">Persistent Cookies </span>
                            which are saved on your device for a fixed period and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Such cookies are used where we need to identify who you are for repeated visits (for instance, to allow us to store your preferences for the next sign-in).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="text-bold">Third-Party Cookies </span>

Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy.</a></p>
